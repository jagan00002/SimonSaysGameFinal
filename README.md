🕹️ How to Play

Press any key to start the game.

Each successful round increases the level and adds a new color to the sequence.

Press any key again to restart.

🧠 Game Logic

The game uses three main arrays:

gameSeq[] – stores the sequence generated by the game

userSeq[] – stores the sequence entered by the user

btns[] – stores all button colors (red, green, yellow, purple)

Key Components

levelUp() → Generates next color, increases level

checkAns() → Checks if user input matches game sequence

gameFlash() → Highlights game’s chosen button

userFlash() → Highlights user’s clicked button

reset() → Resets game after wrong input
